# c_http_server

credit to eric meehans open source C library and guides for help with the C server and data structure tutorials.
I'm using this to learn as a starting point, and will then make this my own.
I am new to C and low level languages, so I have found his guide very helpful with:
1. pointer syntax
2. memory allocation
3. header vs c files
4. C libraries
5. writing C in a more object oriented manner
6. implementation of data structures for an http server (I knew the ds's, but how and why these are actually implemented for a server)
7. thread pools
8. the workflow of sockets in low level
